% Input:
%     matrices        - system matrices F,H,Q etc
%     initials_filter - initials x0,P0
%     measurements    - measurements (where y(t_k) is the k-th column)
% Output:
%     neg_LLF     - negative log LF
%     hatX        - filtered estimate (history) 
%     hatDP       - diag of the filtered error covariance (history)
